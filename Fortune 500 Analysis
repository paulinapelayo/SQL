For this project, I will use a database that has fake Fortune 500 data in it to answer questions based on what I would like to know before working there.

#1. List the companies that provide healthcare benefits and with more than 8 weeks of maternity leave that are in Technology or Retail.
SELECT company_name,  
maternity_leave_weeks AS MLW, 
industry
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE healthcare_benefits = 1
  AND MLW >= 8
  AND (industry = "Retail" 
  OR industry = "Technology")
ORDER BY MLW asc;

#2 Provide the average revenue per industry
SELECT industry, ROUND(AVG(revenue), 2) AS avg_rev
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry;

#3 List the companies that have less than 2000 employees and provide healthcare benefits
SELECT company_name, employees
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE employees <= 2000
  AND healthcare_benefits = 1;

#4 List the companies that provide more than 20 paid days off and more than 8 weeks of maternity leave within the Technology, Retail, or Finance industry.
SELECT industry, 
paid_time_off_days AS paid_days_off,
maternity_leave_weeks AS mlw
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE (industry = "Technology"
  OR industry = "Retail"
  OR industry = "Finance")
  AND paid_days_off >= 20
  AND mlw >= 8;

#5 Provide the average employee tenure for each industry
SELECT industry, 
ROUND(AVG(avg_employee_tenure), 2) AS avg_employee_tenure
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry;

#6 Order each company's maternity leave weeks as: less than 8 weeks "low mlw", less than 12 weeks "med mlw", less than 16 weeks "high mlw".
SELECT company_name, 
maternity_leave_weeks,
  CASE
    WHEN maternity_leave_weeks<=8 THEN 'Low mlw'
    WHEN maternity_leave_weeks<=12 THEN 'Med mlw'
    WHEN maternity_leave_weeks<=16 THEN 'High mlw'
  END AS 'mlw_level'
FROM fortune_companies
ORDER BY maternity_leave_weeks DESC;
